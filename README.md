# Music-Store-Analysis
SQL PROJECT

I am excited to present my Music Store Data Analysis project, where I explored and derived insights from a comprehensive dataset of music store transactions. This project showcases my proficiency in data analysis, SQL querying, and problem-solving as I delved into intricate questions to uncover valuable trends and patterns.
By utilizing SQL, I tackled a variety of questions that offered intriguing insights into the music store's operations and customer behaviors. For instance, I determined the city with the highest invoice count, identified the top-spending customer across albums, and obtained details on customers' return behavior. Additionally, I delved into complex queries to pinpoint information like the favorite genre of rock music enthusiasts and the highest-spending customers from each country.
